/**
 * Algorithm transparency API that can capture all intermediate data structures produced by SourceAFIS algorithm.
 * See <a href="https://sourceafis.machinezoo.com/transparency/">algorithm transparency</a> pages
 * on SourceAFIS website for more information and a tutorial on how to use this class.
 * <p>
 * Applications can subclass {@code FingerprintTransparency} and override
 * {@link #take(String, String, byte[])} method to define new transparency data logger.
 * One default implementation of {@code FingerprintTransparency} is returned by {@link #zip(OutputStream)} method.
 * Applications can control what transparency data gets produced by overriding {@link #accepts(String)}.
 * <p>
 * {@code FingerprintTransparency} instance should be created in a try-with-resources construct.
 * It will be capturing transparency data from all operations on current thread
 * between invocation of the constructor and invocation of {@link #close()} method,
 * which is called automatically in the try-with-resources construct.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://sourceafis.machinezoo.com/transparency/">Algorithm transparency in SourceAFIS</a>

	 * <p>
	 * Parameter {@code key} specifies the kind of transparency data being logged,
	 * usually corresponding to some stage in the algorithm.
	 * Parameter {@code data} then contains the actual transparency data.
	 * This method may be called multiple times with the same {@code key}
	 * if the algorithm produces that kind of transparency data repeatedly.
	 * See <a href="https://sourceafis.machinezoo.com/transparency/">algorithm transparency</a>
	 * on SourceAFIS website for documentation of the structure of the transparency data.
	 * <p>
	 * Transparency data is offered only if {@link #accepts(String)} returns {@code true} for the same {@code key}.
	 * This allows applications to efficiently collect only transparency data that is actually needed.
	 * <p>
	 * MIME type of the transparency data is provided, which may be useful for generic implementations,
	 * for example transparency data browser app that changes type of visualization based on the MIME type.
	 * Most transparency data is serialized in <a href="https://cbor.io/">CBOR</a> format (MIME application/cbor).
	 * <p>
	 * Implementations of this method should be synchronized. Although the current SourceAFIS algorithm is single-threaded,
	 * future versions of SourceAFIS might run some parts of the algorithm in parallel, which would result in concurrent calls to this method.
